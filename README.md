# ML-Predict-Mars-MaxTemp

This project is focused on analysing weather data from Mars, using a dataset named mars-weather.csv. The primary goal is to predict the maximum temperature (max_temp) on Mars using machine learning models.

## Files

1. mars-weather.csv: This CSV file contains the Mars weather data used.
2. mars-analysis.py: Contains code for data visualization, including correlation heatmaps and histograms.
3. single_regression_models.py: Implements single regression models, including Random Forest and Decision Tree regressors.
4. ensemble_learning.py: Applies ensemble learning techniques, specifically bagging and stacking, using base models such as Random Forest and Decision Tree regressors.

## Installation

To run these scripts, you need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
